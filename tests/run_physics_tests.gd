## Integration checks that actually step Godot's physics.
##
## Run with:
##   godot --headless --path . --script res://tests/run_physics_tests.gd
##
## This exists because tests/run_tests.gd cannot. That runner calls methods
## synchronously and never advances a frame, so it can verify the damage RULE
## but not whether move_and_slide reports contacts the way the controller
## assumes. The gap was not theoretical: the first version of TruckController
## trusted move_and_slide to write a blocked result back into velocity, it did
## not, and holding the throttle against a wall re-fired a full speed crash
## every time the contact cooldown expired. Every unit test passed throughout.
##
## Exits 0 only when every check passes, like the other runner.
